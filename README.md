# 🐙 Jules Loader

**Jules Loader** is a native Android application designed to provide a seamless, multi-tabbed browsing experience for [jules.google.com](https://jules.google.com). Built with Kotlin and Material Design, it allows users to navigate repositories and web content efficiently on mobile devices.

## ✨ Features

* **Quick Access**: Instantly load the Jules Home page with a single tap from the "New Tab" screen. 🏠
* **Recent History**: Automatically tracks and saves your recently visited repositories/URLs. The list is managed locally using `SharedPreferences`, ensuring your history persists between sessions. 🕒
* **Full WebView Support**: Features a robust `WebView` implementation with JavaScript, DOM storage, and database support enabled. It also includes a progress bar for page load status. 🌐
* **Material Design**: Clean and modern UI using Android's Material Components. 🎨
